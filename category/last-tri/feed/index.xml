										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Join us for an event made in collaboration with the Careers Department of James Cook University Singapore!</p>



<p>Our Career Craft event provides any student who had participated in the Success Workshops an opportunity to further their insights into how to successfully start your career in the IT industry with the help of an accomplished Lead Game Designer of Paradox Studios which we have invited to give criticism and feedback for your CVs.</p>



<p><strong>Pre-requisites*:</strong></p>



<p>Before the event you are required to create your own CV and transform it yourself according to your own design or using a template that we will provide. </p>



<p>(We recommend participating in the Success Workshop hosted by the James Cook University Careers Department. During which you will be given a basic tutorial on how to create a traditional CV by experts who specialize in helping people get started with their career, after the workshop we will give you a brief crash course on what will happen for the Career Craft event and what to do before the day of the event as well!)</p>



<p>We will be giving interested students the template which they will use to transform the traditional CVs they have created during the Success Workshops into web CV designs that can be typically seen used by industry professionals to showcase their skills. The transformed CV can be based on the template design which we will provide or students can create their own design based on an outline which we will also provide. The transformed CV can be designed through a design software such as Figma or Canva.</p>



<p>Students who wish to participate in the event will have to submit their web CV design on the 27th November or the 28th November.</p>



<p>The event itself will be held on the 30th of November from 2 PM to 3.30 PM, with the schedule being as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Introductions of the Guest Speaker</li>



<li>Feedback and Critique of the submitted CVs</li>



<li>Panel Talk segment where the speaker will share his experience with matters regarding CVs</li>



<li>Q&amp;A Session</li>



<li>Networking Session with refreshments and drinks</li>
</ul>



<p>In the time from between the Success Workshop and the Career Craft event, the students interested in participating in the event can ask questions to any of the iD8 executive committee, where we will help you or refer you to an alumni with rich experience or an industry expert we believe have the answers to your question. We will help you as best as we can in your journey of creating your web CV design!</p>



<p>Students who have designed the best web CV design as judged by our invited speaker will have their CVs published unto the iD8 website here where anyone can view their design!</p>



<p>Join us now by registering through the link provided below and get a head start in developing your career now!</p>
